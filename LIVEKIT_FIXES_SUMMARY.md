# LiveKit Audio Room Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Logger Initialization Issue ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Logger was being used before it was defined in `api/server.js`
**Fix**: Moved logger initialization to the top of the file, before any usage
**Impact**: Prevents server crashes due to undefined logger

### 2. Docker Network Configuration ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: `.env` file was using `localhost` URLs instead of Docker service names
**Fix**: Updated configuration to use Docker service names:
- `LIVEKIT_URL=ws://livekit:7880` (was `ws://localhost:7880`)
- `REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379` (was `redis://localhost:6379`)
**Impact**: Enables proper communication between Docker containers

### 3. Room Timeout Configuration ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Short timeouts causing rooms to be deleted prematurely
**Fix**: Increased timeouts in both `livekit.yaml` and server code:
- `emptyTimeout`: 3600 seconds (60 minutes, was 30 minutes)
- `departureTimeout`: 300 seconds (5 minutes, was 1 minute)
**Impact**: Rooms stay active longer, reducing reconnection issues

### 4. Race Condition in Room Recreation ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Complex locking mechanism causing race conditions when multiple users try to recreate rooms
**Fix**: Simplified room recreation logic:
- Removed Redis-based locking
- Simple try/catch with fallback room existence check
- Consistent timeout values across all room creation points
**Impact**: More reliable room recreation, fewer edge cases

### 5. Enhanced Logging and Monitoring ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Limited visibility into LiveKit connection status and room lifecycle
**Fix**: Added comprehensive logging:
- LiveKit connection testing on startup
- Periodic health checks every 5 minutes
- Detailed room information logging
- Better error handling and stack traces
**Impact**: Easier debugging and monitoring of system health

## Configuration Changes

### LiveKit Configuration (`config/livekit.yaml`)
```yaml
room:
  auto_create: true
  max_participants: 500
  empty_timeout: 3600  # 60 minutes (was 30)
  departure_timeout: 300  # 5 minutes (was 1 minute)
```

### Environment Configuration (`api/.env`)
```bash
# Updated for Docker networking
LIVEKIT_URL=ws://livekit:7880
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379
```

### Server Code Changes
- Logger initialization moved to top of file
- Simplified room recreation logic
- Consistent timeout values (3600s empty, 300s departure)
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Periodic health checks

## New Debug Tools

### 1. Debug Script (`scripts/debug-livekit.sh`)
- Container status checking
- Service health verification
- Log analysis
- Common troubleshooting steps

### 2. Fix Script (`scripts/fix-audio-issues.sh`)
- Complete service restart with proper sequencing
- Health checks for each service
- Clean volume reset
- Comprehensive testing

## Expected Improvements

1. **Room Persistence**: Rooms should stay active for 60 minutes instead of 30
2. **Reconnection Handling**: 5-minute grace period for participant reconnections
3. **Stability**: Eliminated race conditions in room recreation
4. **Debugging**: Better visibility into system state and issues
5. **Reliability**: Proper Docker networking and error handling

## Usage Instructions

### To Apply Fixes
```bash
# Run the comprehensive fix script
./scripts/fix-audio-issues.sh
```

### To Debug Issues
```bash
# Run the debug script
./scripts/debug-livekit.sh
```

### To Monitor Logs
```bash
# View all logs
docker compose logs -f

# View specific service logs
docker compose logs -f livekit
docker compose logs -f nests-api
docker compose logs -f redis
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Host can create a nest successfully
- [ ] Host can join their own nest
- [ ] Participants can join the nest
- [ ] Audio works for all participants
- [ ] Room persists when host temporarily disconnects
- [ ] Room persists when all participants leave briefly
- [ ] Multiple participants can join simultaneously
- [ ] Room restart functionality works
- [ ] Guest access works without authentication

## Monitoring

The system now includes:
- Startup connection testing
- Periodic health checks every 5 minutes
- Detailed logging of room lifecycle events
- Better error reporting with stack traces

## Next Steps

If issues persist after applying these fixes:

1. Check the debug script output: `./scripts/debug-livekit.sh`
2. Review service logs: `docker compose logs -f [service-name]`
3. Verify network connectivity between containers
4. Check LiveKit server configuration and API keys
5. Monitor Redis connectivity and data persistence

The fixes address the core issues of logger crashes, room persistence, and race conditions that were causing the audio rooms to fail.
